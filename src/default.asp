            <h2>More Info:</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the home page of Analog C:Amie Edition, my modified version of the legendary open source statistics compiler Analog found at <a href="http://www.analog.cx/" target="_blank">http://www.analog.cx/</a>.</p>
            <p>This version of Analog has been recompiled by me to include one or two minor tweaks to the Analog formula which I have found lacking in the two years since it was last formally updated by its author.</p>

            <h2>Installation:</h2>
            <p>This edition of Analog is designed to extend upon the release, it is not designed to replace it; why replace something that works.</p>
            <p>All you have to do to use Analog C:Amie Edition is:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Download</strong> Analog from www.analog.cx </li>
              <li><strong>Extract</strong> the file/directory tree from the download zip</li>
              <li><strong>Download</strong> the latest version of Analog C:Amie Edition</li>
              <li><strong>Replace</strong> Analog.exe from the original release with the C:Amie Edition release (renaming the C:Amie file) </li>
              <li>Use Analog as normal  </li>
            </ol>
            <p>I have only compiled Analog for Win32, sorry I do not have any EM64-T systems to build a 64-bit binary and to be honest I am not all that energised to build it for Linux/Unix because I'm not processing log files on it.</p>
            <p>Please by all means use the source files from the downloads section below to build yourself a binary, and if you would like me to host it I will gladly do so on your behalf. </p>
            <h2>Changelog:</h2>
            <p>The table below contains a list of changes made to Analog over and above those of the original 6.0 release from the Analog web site.</p>

            <h2>Known Issues:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Windows Vista and Server 2008 cannot be uniquely identified</li>
              <li>Current unique detections as &quot;Windows Server 2008&quot; are actually &quot;Windows 7&quot; detections   which will now use the user agent &quot;Windows NT 6.1&quot;, accuracy for &quot;Windows 7&quot; detections in 6.0.3 is thus reduced. </li>
            </ul>
